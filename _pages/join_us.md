## PhD Opportunity in Ecosystem Dynamics and Remote Sensing

I am seeking a fully funded PhD student to join my research group in the Department of Biological Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech, starting in Fall 2025. Our group aims to advance the quantification of ecosystem dynamics, deepen the understanding of ecosystem-environment interactions, monitor and model agroecosystems, and inform sustainable management and climate mitigation strategies.

The PhD student will have the opportunity to explore a broad range of research topics and develop the mindsets and skills necessary for conducting independent research within a dynamic and collaborative team. Together, we will tackle grand problems in ecosystem science and climate change, using cutting-edge techniques in big data, machine learning, and modeling. We are committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming environment that promotes career development and professional growth at all levels.

Qualifications: 

- Deep curiosity in scientific inquiry and application with strong self-motivation
- Familiarity with a programming language (Python, R, Julia, Matlab, etc.)
- Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field, such as ecology, geography, environmental science, GIS, remote sensing, hydrology, agronomy, engineering, computer science, data science, etc.

Application process:

Interested candidates, please email a brief description of research interests and experiences along with a CV to Dr. Yanghui Kang (<yanghuikang@vt.edu>). 

The application deadline for the Department of Biological Systems Engineering’s graduate program is January 5, 2025.


## Postdoc Opportunities

We will have postdoc openings very soon in areas of nature-based climate solutions, remote sensing of ecosystems, deep learning, and agroecosystem modeling. Please stay tuned and do not hesitate to contact Dr. Yanghui Kang (<yanghuikang@vt.edu>) for more information. Please include a brief description of research interests and a CV in the email.
